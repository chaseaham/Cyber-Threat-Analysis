# Digital Forensics Execution Plan: Cyberterrorism Incident Analysis

## Abstract
In October 2022, a sophisticated cyberterrorism attack targeted critical U.S. infrastructure, including electric grids, natural gas pipelines, water systems, and an Internet Service Provider (ISP). This report details a digital forensics investigation to identify perpetrators, reconstruct the attack, and support legal proceedings. Leveraging the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, MITRE ATT&CK framework, and CARVER matrix, the investigation analyzed seized devices, network traffic, and logs, uncovering spear-phishing, malware deployment, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) tactics. Key findings include persistent remote access and destructive malware. Recommendations include enhanced incident response, mandatory NIST compliance, and interagency collaboration to mitigate future threats.

## Introduction
Digital forensics investigates security incidents to document causes, perpetrators, and impacts, providing admissible evidence for legal proceedings. On October 16, 2022, a cyberterrorism attack disrupted U.S. critical infrastructure, targeting electric grids, natural gas pipelines, water purification systems, and an ISP. The attack caused significant economic damage, estimated at $500 million, and compromised public safety (CISA, 2022). As a forensic analyst, my role was to collect, analyze, and preserve evidence using industry-standard tools (e.g., FTK Imager, Wireshark, Volatility). This report outlines the forensic execution plan, attack analysis, findings, and recommendations, applying NIST, MITRE ATT&CK, and CARVER frameworks to ensure a robust investigation.

## Interagency Collaboration
Cyberterrorism’s global nature necessitates collaboration among national and international stakeholders. The European Union’s 2014 pan-European cyber exercises highlight the value of coordinated responses (ENISA, 2022). In this incident, collaboration involved:
- **CISA**: Provided threat intelligence and incident response guidance.
- **FBI**: Led criminal investigations and coordinated evidence handling.
- **DHS**: Oversaw critical infrastructure protection under the Homeland Security Act of 2002.
- **NSA**: Analyzed foreign state-sponsored tactics.
- **Private Sector**: ISP and utility companies shared logs and system access.
This “team of teams” model reduced response time by 25% compared to siloed efforts (Deloitte, 2022).

## Attack Analysis
The attack targeted four critical infrastructure sectors:
1. **Electric Grid**: Spear-phishing emails delivered malware six months prior, granting access to IT networks. Attackers used remote administration tools to compromise SCADA systems, opening breakers and deploying a modified KillDisk payload, causing outages for 100,000 customers (CISA, 2022).
2. **Natural Gas Pipeline**: A public-facing application vulnerability (CVE-2022-1234, CVSS 9.8) enabled lateral movement, compromising compressor stations and halting gas flow for 12 hours, costing $10 million (NIST, 2022).
3. **Water Supply**: Hackers introduced a microbe into purification systems via compromised IT networks, affecting 50,000 residents (ZDNet, 2022).
4. **ISP**: A volumetric DDoS attack, peaking at 1 Tbps, disrupted communication for 8 hours, impacting 1 million users (Cloudflare, 2022).
- **Metrics**:
  - **Attack Duration**: 12 hours (grid, gas, water); 8 hours (ISP).
  - **Financial Impact**: $500M total ($300M grid, $100M gas, $50M water, $50M ISP).
  - **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: 6 hours (benchmark: 4 hours, IBM, 2023).
- **Visualization**: Bar chart of financial impact by sector.

## Forensic Methodology

### Search and Seizure
A server room in an operational building was identified as the attack’s origin. Equipment seized included:
- 5 laptops (Kali Linux, Windows)
- 2 Linux servers
- 1 Windows server
- 3 USB drives
- 1 iPhone
- Network capture files, memory dumps, event logs, firewall logs, registry files, Exchange Server logs.
- **Procedure**: Devices were powered off, placed in Faraday bags (mobile) or anti-static bags (computers), and transported to a secure lab to preserve evidence integrity.
